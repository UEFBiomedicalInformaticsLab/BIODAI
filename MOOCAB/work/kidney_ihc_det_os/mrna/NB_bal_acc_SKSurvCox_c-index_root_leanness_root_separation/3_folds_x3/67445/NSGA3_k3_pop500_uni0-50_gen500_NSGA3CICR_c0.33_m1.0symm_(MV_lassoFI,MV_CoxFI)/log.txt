Feature selector:
Multi-objective feature selector with inner composite feature selector with
categorical: feature selector any na and anova
survival: feature selector Cox
Inner optimizer:
Name = NSGA-III multi-view multi-objective optimizer (MO-3-folds creator, pop 500, uniform(0, 50), gen 500, sort NSGA3CICR, crossover 0.33, mutation 1.0 symmetric flip)
Nick = NSGA3_k3_pop500_uni0-50_gen500_NSGA3CICR_c0.33_m1.0symm
Population size = 500
Number of features in initial individuals = uniform(0, 50)
