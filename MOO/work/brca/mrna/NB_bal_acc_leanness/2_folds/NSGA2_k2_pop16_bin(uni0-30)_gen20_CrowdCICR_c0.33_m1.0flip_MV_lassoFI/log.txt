OPTIMIZER DETAILS
Multi-objective optimizer by fold
Nick = NSGA2_k2_pop16_bin(uni0-30)_gen20_CrowdCICR_c0.33_m1.0flip_MV_lassoFI
Inner optimizer:
Name = NSGA-II multi-view multi-objective optimizer (2-folds creator, pop 16, binomial(uniform(0, 30)), gen 20, sort CrowdCICR, crossover 0.33, mutation 1.0 flip)
Nick = NSGA2_k2_pop16_bin(uni0-30)_gen20_CrowdCICR_c0.33_m1.0flip
Population size = 16
Number of features in initial individuals = binomial(uniform(0, 30))
Number of generations = 20
Crossover probability = 0.33
Mutation frequency = 1.0
Mutation operator = flip
Sorting strategy = NSGA2 with crowding distance with Clone Index full elitist and clone repurposing
Objectives = [Pam50 naive Bayes balanced accuracy, leanness]
Hall of fame factories = [Pareto front factory, Best 50 by sum factory]
Folds creator = 2-folds creator
Multi-view feature importance strategy by fold:
multi-objective feature importance
Feature importance for classification: multi-view feature importance lasso
